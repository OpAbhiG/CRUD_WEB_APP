# MyPCOT Technologies CRUD Application

This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application was developed as part of a technical assignment for MyPCOT Technologies. The application provides the following features:

## Features

1. **Login System**: Users can log in using their email address and password. The application handles all error scenarios, ensuring secure authentication.

2. **User Registration**: New users can register with their name, email address, password, and gender.

3. **Create New Records**: Users can create new records, including fields for name, description, category (selectable from a dropdown list fetched from the database), and an option to specify whether the record is active or inactive.

4. **Retrieve Records**: The application allows users to retrieve a list of all records or view a single record. The list can be filtered to show only active or inactive records.

5. **Update Records**: Users can edit and update existing records, including modifying the name, description, category, and active status.

6. **Delete Records**: Records can be deleted individually when viewing a single record or in bulk from the list of records.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: The backend of the application is built using Java, Node.js, or PHP, and it may include microservices for efficient and modular functionality.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using Angular, React, jQuery, or JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the CRUD features.
